The Adventure of the Missing Key

Chapter 1: Sarah, a 28-year-old librarian with curly red hair, worked at the downtown library. She wore a blue cardigan and silver glasses. Every morning, she unlocked the library with a brass key that had three small notches on it.

Chapter 2: On Tuesday, Sarah arrived to find the door already unlocked. Inside, she met Tom, the new janitor, who was 45 years old with a gray beard. He wore green overalls and had been cleaning since 5 AM using a special cleaning solution that smelled like pine.

Chapter 3: Later that day, Sarah discovered her brass key was missing. She remembered placing it in her red leather purse next to her phone charger and a pack of mint gum. The purse was in her office drawer, which was locked with a different silver key.

Chapter 4: Detective Martinez, a woman in her 50s with short black hair and a brown coat, arrived to investigate. She found fingerprints on the door handle and noticed a small piece of fabric caught on the library's front steps.

Chapter 5: The investigation revealed that the missing brass key was actually in the library's lost and found box, placed there by Mrs. Chen, an elderly patron who found it near the poetry section between books about Shakespeare and Emily Dickinson.

Question: What color was Sarah's cardigan and how many notches were on the brass key?
